Industry-leading AI-driven recommendation engine

== Description ==

Are you maximizing AOV to drive profitable growth for your WooCommerce store? Proto AI empowers ecommerce retailers to tackle these challenges with AI-powered product recommendations that deliver highly personalized customer journeys. With personalized recommendations, your customers will purchase more items at each transaction. Since these recommendations are unique to each customer, you will see less returns. Our next generation AI is easy to set up and within days your WooCommerce store will experience higher conversion rates and stronger sales growth.


A SMARTER RECOMMENDATION ENGINE

Most recommendation engines offer alternatives to something users are already interested in (a green tent rather than a blue one) and suggest “best sellers” based on items that similar users have purchased in the past.

By contrast, Proto AI's smart engine solves for the individual user by recommending items that complement what that user is looking at - such as hiking boots for a user who is looking at a tent - whether those items are best sellers or not. The engine will learn and unlearn based on user activity and engagement.


BETTER RESULTS FOR WOOCOMMERCE RETAILERS

Proto AI delivers a better experience for customers - leading them to spend more on relevant products during each transaction - and better results for retailers who experience higher conversion rates, stronger sales growth, and more repeat business.

Best of all, Proto AI requires very little data to function, making it easy for companies to get started quickly and see value in days, not months.
